In this post, I'll share the key milestones and experiences from my web development journey. Starting with basic HTML and CSS, I gradually moved on to JavaScript and advanced frameworks like React and Vue. Each step has taught me valuable lessons in both coding and design.

It's been a rewarding experience to see my skills grow and apply them to real-world projects.
